How to use the app:
Example 1: Classify Single Sentence
python
Copy code
import requests

# Define the API endpoint
api_url = "http://localhost:8000/AntiIsraelClassifier/OneSentence"

# Example sentence
sentence_data = {"sentence": "I support the Israeli government"}

# Make a POST request to the API
response = requests.post(api_url, json=sentence_data)

# Print the response
print(response.json())


api_url = "http://localhost:8000/AntiIsraelClassifier/MultipleSentences"

# Example 2 multiple sentences
multiple_sentences_data = {"list_of_sentences": [
    "I support the Israeli government",
    "I am against the policies of Israel",
    "The conflict in the Middle East is complex"
]}

# Make a POST request to the API
response = requests.post(api_url, json=multiple_sentences_data)

# Print the response
print(response.json())

Example 3: Scoring Multiple Sentences
python
Copy code
import requests

# Define the API endpoint
api_url = "http://localhost:8000/Scoring_Anti_pro_isreali/MultipleSentences"

# Example sentences
multiple_sentences_data = {"list_of_sentences": [
    "I support the Israeli government",
    "I am against the policies of Israel",
    "The conflict in the Middle East is complex"
]}

# Make a POST request to the API
response = requests.post(api_url, json=multiple_sentences_data)

# Print the response
print(response.json())

Make sure to replace "http://localhost:8000" with the actual URL where your FastAPI server is running. Adjust the sentences in the examples based on your needs.
